# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

The main goal of this project is to create a simple "ping" API endpoint that returns "pong". This will serve as a basic health check or a starting point for the API.

## Scope

- **In-Scope:**
    - Create a REST controller.
    - Define a GET endpoint at `/ping`.
    - The endpoint should return the string "pong".

- **Out-of-Scope (for now):**
    - Receiving any kind of request body (like JSON).
    - Database persistence.
    - Complex business logic.
    - Authentication and authorization.
