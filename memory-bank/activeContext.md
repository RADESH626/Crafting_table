# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The user has changed the objective. The new, immediate goal is to create a simple `GET` endpoint at `/ping` that returns the string "pong". This is a much simpler task than the original JSON API.

## Recent Changes

-   **Pivoted Project Goal:** The user requested to change the goal from a JSON-receiving API to a simple ping-pong endpoint.
-   **Updated Documentation:** `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` have been updated to reflect this new goal.
-   Initialized the `memory-bank` directory for project documentation.

## Next Steps

1.  **Update `progress.md`:** Align the progress tracking with the new, simpler goal.
2.  **Develop the implementation plan:**
    -   Create a new package for the API controller.
    -   Implement the `RestController` with a `@GetMapping("/ping")`.
3.  **Present the simplified plan to the user for approval.**

## Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **Simplicity is Key:** The implementation should be as minimal as possible.
-   **No Model Needed:** Since we are not receiving data, a POJO/DTO is no longer necessary.
-   **Use `@GetMapping`:** The endpoint should respond to `GET` requests, which is appropriate for a simple, idempotent read-operation like a health check.
