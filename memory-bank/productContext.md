# Product Context

## Problem to Solve

The user wants to create a very basic API endpoint to confirm that the application is running and responding to requests. This is often called a "health check" or "ping" endpoint.

## How It Should Work

The final solution should be a simple and direct API endpoint.

1.  **Receive Request:** The API must have an endpoint at `/ping` that listens for `GET` requests.
2.  **Process Request:** When a request is received, the application should not need to process any input.
3.  **Respond:** The API should return the plain text string "pong" with an HTTP status of `200 OK`.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Simplicity:** The endpoint should be extremely simple to call and test (e.g., directly in a web browser).
-   **Reliability:** It should always return "pong" as long as the application is running.
-   **Clarity:** The `/ping` path clearly communicates the endpoint's purpose.
