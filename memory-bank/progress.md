# Project Progress

## What Works

-   The basic Spring Boot application structure is in place.
-   The project can be built and run using the Maven wrapper.
-   The documentation foundation (`memory-bank`) has been created and updated to reflect the new goal.

## What's Left to Build

1.  **Create a `controller` package:** To store our REST controller.
2.  **Implement the `RestController`:**
    -   Create a class and annotate it with `@RestController`.
    -   Define a method and annotate it with `@GetMapping("/ping")`.
    -   The method will return the `String` "pong".
3.  **Test the Endpoint:** Run the application and access `http://localhost:8080/ping` in a browser or with `curl`.

## Current Status

-   **Phase:** Planning.
-   **Next Action:** Present the simplified implementation plan to the user for approval.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **Initial Decision:** Start by establishing a robust documentation framework (`memory-bank`).
-   **Pivot:** The user's request changed from a JSON API to a simple ping/pong endpoint. This significantly simplifies the scope.
-   **Reasoning for Pivot:** The user clarified their immediate need was for a basic, functional endpoint. The documentation was updated accordingly to maintain clarity and alignment with the new, simpler goal.
