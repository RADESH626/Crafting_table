# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The application follows a classic three-tier architecture, which is standard for Spring Boot web applications.

1.  **Presentation Layer (Controller):** This is the entry point for all incoming HTTP requests. We will create a `RestController` to handle API requests. It is responsible for receiving the request, validating it at a high level, and delegating to the service layer.
2.  **Service Layer (Business Logic):** This layer will contain the core application logic. For this initial task, the service logic will be minimal—simply processing the received data. In the future, this is where business rules, data manipulation, and coordination between different parts of the application would reside. (Note: We may not create a separate service class for this simple task, keeping the logic within the controller for now).
3.  **Data Access Layer (Repository):** This layer is responsible for data persistence. While it is out of scope for the current task, this is where you would typically find repositories (e.g., using Spring Data JPA) to interact with a database.

## Design Patterns in Use

-   **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Although we are building a REST API (so no "View" in the traditional sense), the separation of concerns aligns with the MVC pattern. The `RestController` acts as the controller, and the POJO acts as the model.
-   **Dependency Injection (DI):** Spring's core feature. We will use DI to manage our components (`RestController`, etc.). This promotes loose coupling and makes the application easier to test and maintain.
-   **Data Transfer Object (DTO):** The POJO we will create serves as a DTO. Its purpose is to carry data between processes—in this case, from the incoming JSON request to our application logic.

## Critical Implementation Paths

The flow of data for our new endpoint will be as follows:

1.  An external client sends a `POST` request with a JSON body to `/api/data`.
2.  The Spring Boot application's embedded server (e.g., Tomcat) receives the request.
3.  The `DispatcherServlet` routes the request to our custom `RestController`.
4.  The `@PostMapping` annotation on our controller method matches the request's URL and HTTP method.
5.  The `@RequestBody` annotation tells Spring to deserialize the JSON body into our Java POJO.
6.  The controller method executes its logic (e.g., logging the received data).
7.  The method returns a `ResponseEntity`, which Spring serializes back into a JSON response and sends to the client with the specified HTTP status.
